      <div class="text">this is rock paper scissors. it's a whale of a game.</div> 
      <div class="text">the first thing you do is you just go right ahead and choose one of these:</div>
      <div class="buttons">
        <button id="rock">rock</button>
        <button id="paper">paper</button>
        <button id="scissors">scissors</button>
      </div>
      <div class="text">the instant you press one of those buttons i will also choose one of rock, paper, or scissors. 
        and then we'll both have chosen.</div>
      <div class="text">then depending on what you chose and depending on what i chose and depending on the rules, 
        you might win or i might win or it might be a tie.</div>
      <div class="text">only time will reveal our fates. we're throwing ourselves at the feet of the cosmic forces 
        of chance, here. no use being timid.</div> 
      <div class="text">at any rate, i'll keep track of our score below. and why don't we play oh let's say first-to-five-wins ok?</div>
